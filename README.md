# PLDAC - Embedded-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project is to explore the possibilities of NVIDIA's Jetson Nano and coral dev Board mini for real-time video processing. The idea is to develop a processing pipeline for the autonomous driving of a small car robot (such as the GoPiGo) in order to compare the performance of different solutions (in terms of calculation time).

The main steps of the project are as follows:
- Getting to know the Jetson and coral platforms, and interfacing either hardware or software between the robot and the board;
- Building a video processing pipeline using existing solutions: video flow acquisition and processing, segmentation algorithms, deep classification models
- Developing a manual controller initially using the perceived information
- If time allows, exploring Reinforcement Learning techniques for accomplishing a specific task.
