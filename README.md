# PLDAC - Embedded Machine Learning
Embedded Machine Learning with PyTorch and Coral USB Accelerator

Explore the world of embedded machine learning with this project. We dive into the evaluation of deep learning models (ResNet, AlexNet, SqueezeNet, VGG) for object detection, measuring inference time and accuracy on both CPU and GPU Linux platforms using PyTorch. Additionally, we leverage Google's Coral USB Accelerator with pycoral to harness hardware acceleration for optimized inference. Dive into the world of edge computing and embedded AI with our in-depth analysis and findings.

Key Highlights:

ðŸš€ Evaluation of deep learning models for object detection.
ðŸ’» Inference time and accuracy comparisons on CPU and GPU.
ðŸ“¡ Expertise in hardware acceleration using Coral USB Accelerator.
ðŸ“Š Quantitative analysis for data-driven model selection.
